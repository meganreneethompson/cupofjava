Ruby Coast Theme Toggler //

This theme toggler is a small web application inspired by the tutorial on the Fireship.io YouTube channel. It allows users to toggle between light, dark and solarized.

Introduction
The Ruby Coast theme toggler provides users with a seamless experience of switching between light, dark and solarized themes with a nod to the sea. This project was created out of a love for the ocean and a a way to practice mixing my knowledge of Html, Css and Javascript together. It was fun!
